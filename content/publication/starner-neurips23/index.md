abstract: Searching for the meaning of an unfamiliar sign-language word in a dictionary is difficult for learners, but emerging sign-recognition technology will soon enable users to search by submitting a video of themselves performing the word they recall. However, sign-recognition technology is imperfect, and users may need to search through a long list of possible results when seeking a desired result. To speed this search, we present a hybrid-search approach, in which users begin with a video-based query and then filter the search results by linguistic properties, e.g., handshape. We interviewed 32 ASL learners about their preferences for the content and appearance of the search-results page and filtering criteria. A between-subjects experiment with 20 ASL learners revealed that our hybrid search system outperformed a video-based search system along multiple satisfaction and performance metrics. Our findings provide guidance for designers of video-based sign-language dictionary search systems, with implications for other search scenarios.
