abstract: This paper describes the design of Mobile Assisted Second Language Learning Application (MASLL) - Kahaniyan - created to assist non-native primary school children in learning Urdu. We explore the use of gamification to assist language learning within the context of interactive storytelling. The final design presented in this paper demonstrates how psychological and linguistic aspects coupled with contextual task analysis can be used to create a second language learning tool. The study also reports the results of the user study and the evaluation of the application which was conducted with 32 primary school students. Our results show a positive influence on learning outcomes, with findings that hold great significance for future work on designing MASLL for languages written in Arabic or Persian script.
